             Send the message unreliably. Can be lost.  Messages *can* be larger than a

             if there is no NAT-traversal accomplished or there is a recognized adjustment
             happening on the connection, the packet will be batched until the connection

            sent soon after you send this, which can be grouped together.  Any time there
            is enough buffered data to fill a packet, the packets will be pushed out immediately,

             will be pretty accurate, since it will be based on the route likely to
             be actually used.
            
             If a direct IP route is used (perhaps via NAT traversal), then the route
             will be different, and the ping time might be better.  Or it might actually
             be a bit worse!  Standard IP routing is frequently suboptimal!
            
             But even in this case, the estimate obtained using this method is a
             reasonable upper bound on the ping time.  (Also it has the advantage
             of returning immediately and not sending any packets.)
            
             In a few cases we might not able to estimate the route.  In this case
             a negative value is returned.  k_nSteamNetworkingPing_Failed means
             the reason was because of some networking difficulty.  (Failure to
             ping, etc)  k_nSteamNetworkingPing_Unknown is returned if we cannot
             currently answer the question for some other reason.
            
             Do you need to be able to do this from a backend/matchmaking server?

            If it's not then no real-time services provided by the SteamworksNet API will be enabled. The Steam 
            client will automatically be trying to recreate the connection as often as possible. When the 
            connection is restored a SteamServersConnected_t callback will be posted.
            You usually don't need to check for this yourself. All of the API calls that rely on this will 
            check internally. Forcefully disabling stuff when the player loses access is usually not a 
            very good experience for the player and you could be preventing them from accessing APIs that do not 
            need a live connection to Steam.

            Functions to control music playback in the steam client.
            This gives games the opportunity to do things like pause the music or lower the volume, 
            when an important cut scene is shown, and start playing afterwards.
            Nothing uses Steam Music though so this can probably get fucked

             <summary>
             If you know that you are going to be using the relay network (for example,
             because you anticipate making P2P connections), call this to initialize the
             relay network.  If you do not call this, the initialization will
             be delayed until the first time you use a feature that requires access
             to the relay network, which will delay that first access.
            
             You can also call this to force a retry if the previous attempt has failed.
             Performing any action that requires access to the relay network will also
             trigger a retry, and so calling this function is never strictly necessary,
             but it can be useful to call it a program launch time, if access to the
             relay network is anticipated.
            
             Use GetRelayNetworkStatus or listen for SteamRelayNetworkStatus_t
             callbacks to know when initialization has completed.
             Typically initialization completes in a few seconds.
            
             Note: dedicated servers hosted in known data centers do *not* need
             to call this, since they do not make routing decisions.  However, if
             the dedicated server will be using P2P functionality, it will act as
             a "client" and this should be called.

             you call this very soon after startup the data may not be available yet.
            
             This always return the most up-to-date information we have available

             Normally this call is unneeded if your game has a constantly running frame loop that calls the 
             D3D Present API, or OGL SwapBuffers API every frame.
            
             However, if you have a game that only refreshes the screen on an event driven basis then that can break 
             the overlay, as it uses your Present/SwapBuffers calls to drive it's internal frame loop and it may also
             need to Present() to the screen any time an even needing a notification happens or when the overlay is
             brought up over the game by a user.  You can use this API to ask the overlay if it currently need a present
             in that case, and then you can check for this periodically (roughly 33hz is desirable) and make sure you
             refresh the screen with Present or SwapBuffers to allow the overlay to do it's work.

            <summary>
            Serialized result sets contain a short signature which can't be forged or replayed across different game sessions.
            A result set can be serialized on the local client, transmitted to other players via your game networking, and 
            deserialized by the remote players.This is a secure way of preventing hackers from lying about posessing 
            rare/high-value items. Serializes a result set with signature bytes to an output buffer.The size of a serialized 
            result depends on the number items which are being serialized.When securely transmitting items to other players, 
            it is recommended to use GetItemsByID first to create a minimal result set.
            Results have a built-in timestamp which will be considered "expired" after an hour has elapsed.See DeserializeResult
            for expiration handling.

            server updater.
